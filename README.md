# Equitable Foreign Aid Distribution
Poverty is a complex issue often resulting from a combination of factors beyond the individual's control such as conflict, institutional corruption, climate, and economic and health policies.<br>
Historically, wealthier, developed nations have taken on the responsibility of providing resources to aid low-middle income countries.<br>
Aid can take the form of military, economic or humanitarian aid with the aim of improving safety, infrastructure, health and other basic human needs, sustainably. One of the many challenges faced is how to optimise aid distribution for lasting, positive change.<br>

Given a set of socio-economic and health data from various countries, this project employs clustering methods with the aim of identifying countries most in need of foreign aid.
